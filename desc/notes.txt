npm run compile




🏆 Complete Feature Set:
✅ Keys → Blue (property highlighting)
✅ Values → Context-aware classification (numbers, strings, booleans, dates)
✅ Operators → Highlighted (=, !=, <>, <=, >=, <, >, +, -, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, IS, NULL, AND, OR, NOT)
✅ Underscores (_) → Blue placeholder highlighting
✅ Single quotes (') → Always highlighted as string content
✅ Double quotes (") → Highlighted as string delimiters
✅ Colons (:) → Distinct color for key-value separators
✅ Semicolons (;) → Distinct color anywhere they appear
✅ Percentage (%) → Only highlighted inside single-quoted strings
✅ Context-aware rules → Nothing highlighted inside single quotes except %

🛠 Robust Architecture:
Dual-layer system: TextMate grammar + Semantic tokens
Context sensitivity: Different behavior inside vs outside single quotes
Global coverage: Works in all contexts (key:value, key-only, multiline, arrays)
Conflict resolution: Proper token precedence and overlap handling
Performance optimized: Efficient regex patterns and parsing logic
